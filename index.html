    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
    <p>
      I enjoy baking. I made my first batch of macarons in 2020 during the
      pandemic. I have since taken two macaraon baking classes at Harmons and
      baked several batches over the past few years. I taught a class to a few
      women in my neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      K-dramas are my new go-to choice on Netflix. The first K-drama I watched
      was Extraordinary Attorney Woo. It drew me in and I have watched several
      other shows, including anything from period piece to horror to fantasy!
    </p>
    <p>
      A new found passion of mine is travel! My husband and I went to Peru in
      2023. It was beautiful, and the food was to die for. I went to New York
      for the first time with a friend last year, and am hoping to go to Japan
      with my family at the end of this year. I went when I was about 13, but I
      don't think I fully appreciated it. France is on my bucket list of places
      to visit.
