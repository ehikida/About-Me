  I have a hard time keeping houseplants alive.

  <h2>My personal interests</h2>
  <p>
    I enjoy baking. I made my first batch of macarons in 2020 during the
    pandemic. I have since taken two macaraon baking classes at Harmons and
    baked several batches over the past few years. I taught a class to a few
    women in my neighborhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    K-dramas are my new go-to choice on Netflix. The first K-drama I watched
    was Extraordinary Attorney Woo. It drew me in and I have watched several
    other shows, including anything from period piece to horror to fantasy!
  </p>
  <p>
    A new found passion of mine is travel! My husband and I went to Peru in
    2023. It was beautiful, and the food was to die for. I went to New York
    for the first time with a friend last year, and am hoping to go to Japan
    with my family at the end of this year. I went when I was about 13, but I
    don't think I fully appreciated it. France is on my bucket list of places
    to visit.
